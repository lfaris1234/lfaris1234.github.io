  <h1>Where Art Meets Code</h1>
  <div class="timestamp">August 2025</div>
  <p>
    In this essay I reflect on the intersection of art, creativity, and computer science. For me, programming has always felt like another form of creative expression—just as much as painting, writing, or composing music. Both fields involve problem-solving, experimentation, and pushing against constraints to discover something new.
  </p>
  <p>
    Code, when written thoughtfully, can be elegant and expressive. And art, when infused with computational thinking, gains new dimensions—interactivity, generativity, and even autonomy. The two disciplines meet in fields like generative art, creative coding, AI music transcription, and visualization tools, but they also share a mindset: the willingness to iterate, to fail forward, and to make something meaningful out of abstract ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    My journey in both art and computer science has taught me that the boundaries between disciplines are more porous than they appear. Where art brings intuition and vision, computer science brings structure and power. Together, they shape not just technology, but culture.
