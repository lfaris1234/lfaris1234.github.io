  <h1>Workaway in Greece</h1>
  <div class="timestamp">July-August, 2025</div>
  <p>
   This summer (2025) I traveled to Greece and spent a little less than a month on the Eastern coast of Athens, in Porto Rafti, doing a Workaway with a woman, author, artist, and PhD in criminology and wrongful convictions. She was having some trouble with her website and I spent a decent amount of my time with her untangling some seriously confusing website backend issues. Her husband, a musician, had a similar issue somewhat related to outdated and incompatible hosting services. 
 </p>
 <p>
   Along the way, I learned a new hosting platform, <em>Host Europe</em>, and picked up some pretty fun hands-on web dev and data maintenance skills. In the end it all got fixed, she and I were both pretty happy about it, and we went out for ice cream to celebrate. It was completely not how I was expecting to spend my time internationally travelling in post-grad celebration, and an incredibly welcome reminder that I can keep learning in tech everywhere I go.
