  <h1>Workaway in Greece: tech fixes by the sea</h1>
  <div class="timestamp">August 16, 2025</div>
  <p>
    This summer (2025) I traveled to Greece for about a month and spent a few weeks in Porto Rafti on a Workaway. I helped my work host— a postdoc researcher in wrongful convictions and criminology (and an author) — untangle some seriously messed-up website backend issues. Along the way I learned a new hosting platform, <em>Host Europe</em>, and picked up a lot of hands-on web dev and data maintenance skills. It was a really fun reminder that I can keep learning in tech everywhere I go.
